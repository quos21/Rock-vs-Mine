# Rock-vs-Mine
This is a ML program that determines whether an object is a rock or a mine based on an array of data. I have used Logistic Regression as the linear model as it was the best fit and not overfitting the data. Every module used belongs to the sklearn package and the data set has been taken from kaggle.
